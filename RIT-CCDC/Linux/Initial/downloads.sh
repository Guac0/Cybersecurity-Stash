# Created by Guac0 using code from vipersniper0501 for CCDC 2024

# Objective:
# Have a central downloader script that'll fetch all the other scripts and etc.
# Also install some common packages and shell stuff

# Usage:
# Note - Tested on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04.03
# 1. Install curl via "sudo apt install curl"
# 2. Obtain this script via "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCDC-RIT/Linux-Scripts/main/Initial/downloads.sh > downloader.sh"
# 3. Run it via "sudo sh downloads" or your equivalent bash execution method
#      If you get an error like "useradd command not found", start a superuser session with "su -l"
# 4. If you get configuration popups, the defaults should likely work fine.
# 5. The script will then automatically delete itself. The installed scripts are located in /home/blue/Linux-Scripts

# Tasks/Questions:
# Where do we download these files to? - blue user home directory in scripts folder
# Migrate downloading and installing honeypot - done
# Download and install packages - done (well, the original ones given to me at least)
# General move from 5MinPlan.sh to this - done
# Add inter-OS interdependency - done


# check for root for installs and exit if not found
