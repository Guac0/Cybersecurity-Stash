# Pre-condition: a file called users.txt exists in the same directory, with a list of users whose information should be changed (can be obtained by running getUsers.sh)
# Additional pre-condition for RHEL IDM functionality: Valid Kerberos ticket (obtained by using the "kinit admin" command) and a file called idm_users.txt exists in the current directory, which can be created by running getIDMusers.sh or idm_usersAndGroups.sh
